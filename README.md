# LocalStorage Project

## Intent:
This project was intended as a way to introduce to myself the use of the localStorage object and its methods. The end result provided valuable insight as to how this API works and a usable tool to track these very specific statistics about the game [Territory Idle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1017100/Territory_Idle/).

## Known issues:
Chrome does not appear to persist the changes based on the current set up. It works on Firefox and Edge, so the issue appears to be specific to Chrome. It may have something to do with the necessity to read a key before it will store the saved data rather than just declaring what to save or maybe not. As of right now I am not concerned with attempting to fix this. Cross browser support shouldn't be this difficult. Why can't the browser companies just use the same protocols? 

## Disclaimer:
I have no affiliation with, about, for, or regarding the author of the game. The title and all content regarding trademarks are property of their respective owners. I just made this for fun and coding experience.
